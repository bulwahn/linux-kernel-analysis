# Installing Infer #
We need to compile and install infer from source code , in order to be able to hack it later. 
You can find facebook/infer's source code [here](https://github.com/facebook/infer) or you can use following command: 
```git clone https://github.com/facebook/infer.git```
## My current setup ##
**Host OS:** Ubuntu 64-bit 16.04  
**Kernel Version To Be Checked with Infer:** Linux 4.15 Stable  
**Kernel Compilation Configuration:** defconfig  
**Infer fork with HEAD commit:** 4799fb6b8226("[racerd] skeleton for testing access path stability")  
**Clang:** clang version 3.8.0-2ubuntu4 (tags/RELEASE_380/final)  

## Prerequisites ##
You can find latest prerequisites for your operating system for building infer [here](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

## Dependency Problems I have encountered during Compilation ##
Even though I have installed this prerequisites, I had some problems with:
- sqlite3.4.3.2 ```opam depext sqlite3.4.3.2```
- camlzip.1.0.7 ```opam depext camlzip.1.07```
- cmake ```sudo apt-get install cmake```

## Compile Infer ##
After cloning infer to your computer, and installing all required files. You can start compiling with infer with ```./build_infer.sh``` command.

## Install Infer ##
After infer build finished, you can install it with using ```make install``` command. Now you are able to run infer from your command line.

## Packages Needed to build Linux Kernel ##
You need some extra packages, to become able to compile linux 4.15 from source code. In my case they were:  
- libelf-dev ```sudo apt-get install libelf-dev```  
- libssl-dev ```sudo apt-get install libssl-dev```

## Prepare to Run Infer on Linux Kernel ##

Now you can :
- Compile Linux 4.15 without getting any errors
- Call infer via command line

To use infer with linux-kernel, first you must capture Linux 4.15 source code with ```infer capture -- make``` command , and then analyse infer-out folder with ```infer analyse```. However with current setup Infer can't capture Linux 4.15 source code. To be able to get an output you need to make some modifications. I explained required modifications below, with two solutions for each of them.

## Modify Infer to mark problematic directories blacklisted ##
First of all, we need to mark some linux directories as blacklisted, to avoid compilation errors during ```infer capture``` phase.
To do this you have two options and I prefer second option.

### Modify Infer source code ###
You can directly modify your infer fork, and mark directories as blacklisted with help of [patch](../scripts/files/0001-Blacklist-files-from-infer-source-code.patch), please don't forget to modify file paths which passed as parameter before applying it.

### Add an inferconfig file ###

Thanks to [@Evan Zhao](https://github.com/Tacinight) we have much simplier and flexible way to solve this problem. You can create an ```.inferconfig``` file in linux-kernel root directory and then mark problematics directories as blacklisted as following: (Please do not forget replace file paths with absolute paths.)
You can do it via execute ```echo $PWD``` in linux-stable root directory. Then delete first ``` \ ``` and replace ```[linux-stable-absolute-path]```'s with rest of string.
Example :  
```"home/ozan/linux-stable/stable/linux-stable/mm"```  

```
{
"skip-analysis-in-path": 
[
"[linux-stable-absolute-path]/arch/x86/entry/vdso",
"[linux-stable-absolute-path]/arch/x86/kernel", 
"[linux-stable-absolute-path]/arch/x86/mm", 
"[linux-stable-absolute-path]/arch/x86/boot", 
"[linux-stable-absolute-path]/drivers/acpi", 
"[linux-stable-absolute-path]/fs", 
"[linux-stable-absolute-path]/kernel/bpf", 
"[linux-stable-absolute-path]/mm", 
"[linux-stable-absolute-path]/net/mac80211"
]
}
```
You can find why you should these files into the blacklist; and if you dont them, add what kind of error they create at : [Blacklisted-Files-Explanations](../infer/Documentation/BlacklistExplanation) folder.


## Set default CC to clang for linux-kernel compilation ##

After that, we need to set clang as a default compiler when we start infer capture phase with ```infer capture -- make``` command.  Otherwise Linux Makefiles uses gcc flags, and since infer compiles with clang, we need clang compiler flags for a successfull compilation.
For this issue again we have two different solutions, and I prefer second one.

### GCC Hack ###
It is a serious hack, which may breaks your other builds. Basically we just point ```gcc``` command to clang compiler. If you want to use this method I strongly encourage you to take a backup.

- Open terminal
- ```cd /usr/bin```
- ```sudo ln -sf clang gcc```

### Patch file for Linux ###

Another way is applying [this patch](../scripts/files/0001-Set-default-CC-to-Clang-from-Makefile.patch), to top of linux 4.15. After that you won't have any problems about compiler flags.

## Run Infer on Linux Kernel ##

After all this configurations, you are ready to compile linux kernel with infer:

- Go to Linux-kernel root directory.
- ```make clean && make defconfig```
- ```infer capture -- make```
After ```infer capture -- make``` completed you can observe infer creates a directory named infer-out. So now we should execute```infer analyze``` command and get output from infer-out folder. But it may take a lot of time and need huge computing power.
- Again from linux-kernel root directory,
- Execute ```infer analyze```
- Look for results with ```cat /infer-out/bugs.txt```
## Common problems ##

### Base_64.S problem ###
after executing ```infer capture -- make``` command if you get error messages as:
``` <instantiation>:4:8: error: expected absolute expression
 .skip -(((144f-143f)-(141b-140b)) > 0) * ((144f-143f)-(141b-140b)),0x90
       ^
<instantiation>:4:8: error: expected absolute expression
 .skip -(((144f-143f)-(141b-140b)) > 0) * ((144f-143f)-(141b-140b)),0x90
       ^
<instantiation>:4:8: error: expected absolute expression
 .skip -(((144f-143f)-(141b-140b)) > 0) * ((144f-143f)-(141b-140b)),0x90
       ^
```
during compilation of base64.S file, that means linux makefile still using wrong flags during compilation, I suggest you to look at **Set default CC to clang for linux-kernel compilation** section again. To avoid that kind of errors, Makefiles adds different compiler flags according to selected compiler. For example in this case we need -no-integrated-as flag to avoid using clang's integrated assembler.
### objcopy: 'arch/x86/entry/vdso/vdso64.so.dbg': No such file problem ###
If you get  
```
arch/x86/entry/vdso/vclock_gettime.o: In function `__vdso_time':
vclock_gettime.c:(.text+0x667): undefined reference to `memcpy'
arch/x86/entry/vdso/vclock_gettime.o: In function `gtod_read_begin':
vclock_gettime.c:(.text+0x734): undefined reference to `memcpy'
Error: the following clang command did not run successfully:
```  
error during ```infer capture``` phase, you should re-do mark problematic directories blacklisted step. Maybe you can check if your directory paths are written correctly. Please not that directories shouldn't start with ``` \ ```  
**Invalid:**  
```"/home/ozan/linux-stable/stable/linux-stable/mm"```    
**Valid:**  
```"home/ozan/linux-stable/stable/linux-stable/mm"```  


## Using Docker for Kernel-Analysis with Infer ##

You can do all this process , with using Docker. It is the most basic and straightforward way to run infer on Linux Kernel.
To do this, please follow the instructions below.
- Clone repository ```git clone https://github.com/bulwahn/linux-kernel-analysis.git```
- Follow [Setup](Setup.md) instructions, clone at least linux-stable to your computer and be sure that you set```KERNEL_SRC_BASE```
- Go to scripts directory ```cd ~/linux-kernel-analysis/scripts```
- Run ```./build_infer_docker.sh``` and build docker file.
- Run ```./analyse_kernel.sh```, That script completes all required steps that described above, then will run ```infer capture -- make``` on linux-kernel. You can call it with various parameters. Please see detailed instructions about ```analyse_kernel.sh``` script at (manual-for-infer-analyse-script)[InferAnalyseScriptManual.md]
