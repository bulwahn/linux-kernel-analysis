The file warnings-v4.16+cherries-maxyesconfig-clang-5.0 was produced with:
  - linux v4.16 and some cherry-picked commits (cf. current pull request #9)
  - allyesconfig with disabled DCN 1.0 Raven Family and disabled Qualcomm 8x16 V4L2 Camera Subsystem Driver (cf. current pull request #9)
  - clang-5.0

The command to produce the file is:
```
[sudo] make CC=clang-5.0 HOSTCC=clang-5.0 2>&1 > /dev/null | tee warnings-v4.16+cherries-maxyesconfig-clang-5.0
```

Remarks:
  - It was executed with sudo, due to some left-overs from some previous docker container runs.
  - To ensure that the file is reproducibly the same, I executed the command twice with an intermediate make clean and I obtained the same file with warnings.
